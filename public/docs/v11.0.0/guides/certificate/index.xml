FAQ Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt FAQs How do I renew my LE certificates? LE issues certificates that are valid for 90 days. Since 10.0.0 release, Voyager operator will try renewing your certificate 15 days (was 7 days in prior releases) prior to expiration. You can also configure how soon Voyager should try to renew the certificate by setting the spec.renewalBufferDays field in Certificate crd. Once renewed certificates are issued, HAProxy will be automatically updated to use the new certificates.</description></item><item><title>Certificate | Voyager</title><link>https://voyagermesh.com/docs/v11.0.0/guides/certificate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://voyagermesh.com/docs/v11.0.0/guides/certificate/</guid><description>Guides Guides show you how to use Voyager&amp;rsquo;s built-in certificate manager to issue free TLS/SSL certificates from Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.

Deleting Certificate Pausing Certificte Voyager operator periodically (default 5 mins) checks each certificate whether whether it needs to be reissued. If you have a bad configuration (example, bad dns credentials), this can led to rate limit issued with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. You can delete the certificate object to stop retries. Alternatively, you can mark the certificate object as spec.paused: true. This will cause Voyager operator to skip checking this certificate for renewals.</description></item></channel></rss>
