FAQ Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt FAQs How do I renew my LE certificates? LE issues certificates that are valid for 90 days. Voyager operator will try renewing your certificate 7 days prior to expiration.

Deleting Certificate Pausing Certificte Voyager operator periodically (default 5 mins) checks each certificate whether whether it needs to be reissued. If you have a bad configuration (example, bad dns credentials), this can led to rate limit issued with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. You can delete the certificate object to stop retries. Alternatively, you can mark the certificate object as spec.paused: true. This will cause Voyager operator to skip checking this certificate for renewals.</description></item></channel></rss>
